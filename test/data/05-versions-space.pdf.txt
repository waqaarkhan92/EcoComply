Permit number EPR/UP3624SW 
Introductory note 
This introductory note does not form a part of the notice. 
The main features of the permit are as follows.   
The permit authorises the operation of standby electricity generating plant at a data centre located within a 
light industrial and commercial area in Hayes in the London Borough of Hillingdon at national grid reference 
TQ 08045 79594. The data centre will under normal operating conditions be powered by grid supplied 
electricity. 
 
The installation falls under the following Environmental Permitting Regulations (EPR) Schedule 1 listed 
activity description: 
Section 1.1 Part A(1)(a) - Burning any fuel in an appliance with a rated thermal input of 50 or more megawatts.  
 
The installation comprises 16 stand-by backup generators to provide electrical power to the data centre in 
the event of a failure of power supply from the national grid. The standby generators are 6.9 MW
th
 new 
medium combustion plant (MCP) diesel generators with an aggregated thermal input of 110 MW
th
.  
 
The plant is limited to operating less than 500 hours/year, including the testing regime. It is estimated that 
each engine will be tested for approximately 5 hours/year. It is essential that the standby system is routinely 
tested to ensure the engines function correctly in the event of them being required to operate in an 
emergency. 
 
Each engine will be tested one at a time at low load (up to 10%  for up to 15 minutes) once a month for 11 
months per year; then each engine will be tested individually at full load once per year for 20 minutes followed 
by 75%  load for  120 minutes. Each engine has its own integrally bunded fuel storage tank. Exhaust gases 
from each engine will be discharged through an individual 14.45m flue. Each of the generators are fitted with 
Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) abatement to reduce emissions to air of oxides of nitrogen (NO
x
). 
 
There will be no process effluent discharged from the installation. Uncontaminated surface water run-off from 
the  roof  and  hard-standing  will  drain  via  oil-water  separators  to  the  surface  water  drainage  system before 
discharging to ground via a soakaway.  
 
Southwest London Waterbodies Special Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar site is located within 10km of the 
installation and there are a number  of Local  Wildlife  Sites (LWS) within 2km of  the installation. The closest 
residential properties are located approximately 30m from the data centre boundary. 
There will be an Environmental Management System (EMS) in place based on the ISO 14001 standard.

The operator shall produce an AQMP in conjunction with the Local 
Authority outlining response measures to be taken in the event of a grid 
failure. This must include, but not be limited to, the following 
considerations:  
• The response should be tailored to reflect the predicted potential 
impact indicated by the air dispersion modelling at individual 
receptors;  
• Preventative and reactive actions to be implemented to limit the 
duration of an outage event to less than 50 hours as far as 
possible; 
• Specific timescales for response measures; 
• How local conditions during a grid failure might influence the 
response required, for example meteorological conditions or 
time of day; 
• Contingency for how the response will be carried out in the 
event scenario i.e. loss of power;  
• Timescales for continued review of the management plan. 
The agreed Air Quality Management Plan shall be submitted to the

Commissioning 
At least one month before operation the operator shall submit a commissioning plan to 
the Environment Agency for approval.  The plan shall provide timescales for the 
commissioning of the diesel generators and shall demonstrate that the commissioning 
of the diesel generators is covered within the site’s permitted regular testing regime, 
thereby minimising durations and impacts. 
When the commissioning is not covered within the site’s permitted regular testing 
regime, the operator shall submit an environmental risk assessment for approval by 
the Environment Agency, demonstrating that the environmental risks during the 
commissioning are minimised and remain not significant. The commissioning of the 
engines shall not begin prior to receiving written approval to the plan and associated

Schedule 6 – Interpretation 
“accident” means an accident that may result in pollution. 
“application” means the application for this permit, together with any additional information supplied by the 
operator as part of the application and any response to a notice served under Schedule 5 to the EP 
Regulations. 
“authorised officer” means any person authorised by the Environment Agency under section 108(1) of The 
Environment Act 1995 to exercise, in accordance with the terms of any such authorisation, any power 
specified in section 108(4) of that Act. 
“emissions to land” includes emissions to groundwater. 
“EP Regulations” means The Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations SI 2016 No.1154 
and words and expressions used in this permit which are also used in the Regulations have the same 
meanings as in those Regulations. 
“emissions of substances not controlled by emission limits” means emissions of substances to air, water or 
land from the activities, either from the emission points specified in schedule 3 or from other localised or 
diffuse sources, which are not controlled by an emission limit. 
“gas oil” includes diesel and is defined in Article 3(19) of the MCPD. 
“groundwater” means all water, which is below the surface of the ground in the saturation zone and in direct 
contact with the ground or subsoil. 
“Industrial Emissions Directive” means DIRECTIVE 2010/75/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND 
OF THE COUNCIL of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions, as read in accordance with Schedule 1A 
to the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016. 
“MCERTS” means the Environment Agency’s Monitoring Certification Scheme. 
“Medium Combustion Plant” or ”MCP” means a combustion plant with a rated thermal input equal to or 
greater than 1 MW but less than 50 MW. 
“Medium Combustion Plant Directive” or “MCPD” means Directive 2015/2193/EU of the European Parliament 
and of the Council on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from medium combustion 
plants, as read in accordance with Schedule 1A to the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) 
Regulations 2016. 
“Net rated thermal input” means the rate at which fuel can be burned at the maximum continuous rating of 
the appliance multiplied by the net calorific value of the fuel and expressed as megawatts thermal.  
“new MCP” means an MCP first put into operation on or after 20/12/2018.  
 
“operating hours” means the time, expressed in hours, during which a combustion plant is operating and 
discharging emissions into the air, excluding start-up and shut-down periods.  
“shut-down” is any period where the plant is being returned to a non-operational state. 
“start-up” is any period, where the plant has been non-operational, until fuel has been fed to the plant to 
initiate steady-state conditions. 
“year” means calendar year ending 31 December. 
 
 

 
Permit number 
EPR/UP3624SW 23 
Where a minimum limit is set for any emission parameter, for example pH, reference to exceeding the limit 
shall mean that the parameter shall not be less than that limit. 
Unless otherwise stated, any references in this permit to concentrations of substances in emissions into air 
means: 
• in relation to emissions from combustion processes, the concentration in dry air at a temperature of 
273K, at a pressure of 101.3 kPa and with an oxygen content of 3% dry for liquid and gaseous fuels, 6% 
dry for solid fuels; and/or 
• in relation to emissions from non-combustion sources, the concentration at a temperature of 273K and at 
a pressure of 101.3 kPa, with no correction for water vapour content.
